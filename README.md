# JavaScript-Timed-Quiz

In Homework-4, I have completed all of the acceptance criteria, including:
- There is a time decrement of 10 seconds everytime you get a question wrong
- The quiz ends when the timer reaches zero
- The timer starts when the quiz starts
- You are able to see and save your scores and initials using local storage
